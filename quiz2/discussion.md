#### Aristophanes’ Attitude Towards Women

Q1: Explain Aristophanes’ attitude toward women, particularly as he depicts them in Lysistrata. Was he an early feminist?

A1: It's debatable. It's true that on the surface, Aristophanes drew this independent, free-minded woman to perhaps represent a group of woman, however, the purpose of him doing or making this character might have a deeper meaning. I read a bit about Aristophanes's biography, his political view tends to be against warfare, and the fact that he mentioned in Lysistrata where women were trying to get involved in politic to stop warfare and consolidate the city is a reflection of his political view. Another thing is to think of women's social status at the time, most of them are housewife and have little or no voice in politics; I feel like Aristophanes not necessary are trying to convey women should get more rights than men, rather, he is using women should get into politic as a sarcasm for the inability of man running the city, that even women/housewife should get involved to help them from their mess.

Q2: How did his ideas in the play reinforce or challenge male attitudes toward women in fifth-century BCE Athens?

A2: The attendance of women in groups peace discussions weren't a thing back in the era. The idea of equal voice was something to pursuit, however never implemented in the society. By having a scene in which women would also share their spirits freely indicated that Aristophanes is challenge male attitudes in any way. Again, this view could also be seen from another angle if what Aristophanes purpose was really trying to make fun of the men who run the city at the time, I get the feeling that Aristophanes isn't quite happy of the society the way it is, so sarcasm or feminism from his poetry can be debatable.


#### Acharnians & Democracy

Q: Using specific examples from Acharnians, explain how the plays of Aristophanes portrayed democracy and what these portrayals suggest about Aristophanes’ political orientation.

A: Dikaiopolis or the character's mentality match closely with Aristophane's own political mind. The reason that the play was considered a comedy is through many sarcastic moments. For example, when Dicaeopolis was confronting against Lamachus in their political debates: the seemly usual act turned into a "fisting" play, which is highly unlikely in a real social environment.

Dikaiopolis favors peace over war, many of his decisions proved this.

1. Dikaiopolis meets Amphitheus, a man who claims that he can make peace with the Spartans, and Dikaiopolis pays him eight drachmas.

2. Through Lamachus and Dikaiopolis's argument, by the end of the fight, the entire chorus is won over by Dikaiopolis’ arguments. Since this is a fictional comedy, the chorus, on the other hand, reflected Aristophanes's personal opinion.

3. Lamachus ended up heavily wounded where Lamachus ended up happy eating with two girls into his arm indicated the bias opinion from Aristophanes: that war = pain, and peace = happiness.

Regarding democracy, I feel that Aristophanes is also criticizing the nature of the true democracy in the society. Lamuchus who seemly were chosen by the "people" didn't act for the people's interests. The fact that Amphitheus had no voice in public is because the upper management refused for compromising. And the shifting of the chorus opinion also reflecting the feeling of the normal people over the decision over the people in power, that people crave peace, and they are tired of war. In a nutshell, I believe Aristophanes also expects more from its Democracy, for it to serve people in a better level
