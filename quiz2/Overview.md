#### Vocab.
* **Cleon**:  引发了("Peloponnesian War") - Creator of "Peloponnesian War". Aristophanes fiercely ridiculed Cleon, the city’s most prominent leader early in the Peloponnesian War, that Cleon sued him. A citizen jury ruled in Aristophanes’ favor, upholding the Athenian tradition of free speech.

* **Agon**:In Ancient Greek drama, Agon refers to a contest or debate between two characters - the protagonist and the antagonist - in the highly structured Classical tragedies and dramas. There is no such agon in this play. There is a heated argument between the protagonist and the Chorus in couplets of long trochaic verses framed by a stropheand antistrophe (303–334) but the main arguments for and against war are conducted in ordinary dialogue of iambic trimeter, including input from Lamachus as the antagonist.

* **Lenaea** an annual Athenian festival with a dramatic competition, Many of Aristophanes' plays were first performed there

* **Dionysia**:a festival held early in spring when the seas were navigable and the city was crowded with foreigners.

* **Theater of Dionysus** : 为了Dionysia建造的场所，能容纳17000人。The Theatre of Dionysus Eleuthereus is a major theatre in Athens, built at the foot of the Athenian Acropolis. Dedicated to Dionysus, the god of plays and wine (among other things), the theatre could seat as many as 17,000 people with excellent acoustics,[1] making it an ideal location for ancient Athens' biggest theatrical celebration, the Dionysia.

* **Choregoi** "chorus leaders", who were dressed in the most expensive and ornate clothing.

* **Parabasis**(古希腊喜剧演出中插在剧情间的)**合唱队主唱段**): Here the first parabasis follows a conventional form (lines 626–701). However, the second parabasis (lines 971-99) is unusual. It can be interpreted as a conventional symmetrical scene[71] and yet it seems to be a hybrid parabasis/song without any clear distinction between the sung and declaimed sections.[72] Moreover, the Chorus in those lines seems to comment on action that occurs on stage during its address to the audience and this is unusual for a parabasis. A later passage (lines 1143–73) begins with a valediction to the actors, which typically clears the stage for a parabasis[73] and yet it has the form of a conventional song rather than a parabasis.

* **Pnyx**: (Dikaiopolis在剧里最初坐得地方) ： The play begins with Dikaiopolis sitting all alone on the Pnyx (the hill where the Athenian Assembly or ecclesia regularly meets to discuss matters of state).

* **Megara** (被战争影响的领边城镇，支持斯巴达而被雅典迫害) Megara： The Athenians always remained behind their city walls until the enemy returned home, whereupon they would march out to wreak revenge on their pro-Spartan neighbours – Megara in particular. It was a war of attrition, it had already resulted in daily privations, in starvation and plague, and yet democratic Athens continued to be guided by the pro-war faction led by Cleon and exemplified by tough-minded militarists such as Lamachus.
* **Probouloi** （Lysistrata里面的高官）：In the comedy Lysistrata, a proboulos goes on a tirade against Lysistrata after losing a long debate.
