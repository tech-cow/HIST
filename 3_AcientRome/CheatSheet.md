* Twelve Tables（最早的法律）：

  * To pressure the patricians, the plebeians periodically refused military service. This tactic worked because Rome’s army depended on plebeian manpower; the patricians were too few to defend Rome by themselves. The patricians therefore agreed to written laws guaranteeing greater equality and social mobility. The earliest Roman law code, the Twelve Tables, was enacted between 451 and 449 B.C.E. in response to this tactic.
