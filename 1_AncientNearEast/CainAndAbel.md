# **Genesis** - Chapter 4

At the beginning of the readings, I pose questions to help you think about the readings.  By thinking about the answers to these questions, you are more likely to be prepared for the online discussions and quizzes, but you do not have to answer them directly.  These question are merely here to stimulate thought..  

###### Thought Prep Questions:
1. Based on the characterization of Cain and Abel, did God prefer shepherds or tillers of the soil?
2. How is this characterization of God related to the early culture of the ancient Hebrews?
3. How is this characterization of activities associated with the Neolithic Revolution?
4. What does the text suggest about the marriage practices of the ancient Hebrews?
5. What does the text suggest about the importance of families? How does fratricide fit into this perspective?
6. Why did God punish Cain this way? Why not put him to death?

###### Discussion Questions:

1. What features of the ancient Hebrew culture made the story of Cain and Abel appealing?
2. What does the story suggest about the Hebrewsâ€™ attitudes toward animal husbandry, agricultural labor, and kinship?
