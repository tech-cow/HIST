#### Cain & Abel | Q:
What features of the ancient Hebrew culture made the story of Cain and Abel appealing? What does the story suggest about the Hebrewsâ€™ attitudes toward animal husbandry, agricultural labor, and kinship?

#### A:
In my opinion, there are two value-centric lessons about Hebrew from the story Cain and Abel:

* **First Value**: Sacrifice from oneself to please other, or simply unselfishness is considered a good practice
Reason: It didn't make much sense to me the first time that I went over the reading regarding why God favors Abel's sheep over Cain's corp, but then I realize the following "Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions." Thus Cain brought the fruit of the ground to offer to the God while Abel's offering was the first of the flock and of the fat. This would have been the richest and best portion of the animal, demonstrating that Abel brought his best to the Lord.
* **Second Value**: Kinship is considered an important part of the human being:
Reason: The fact that God punished Cain for murdering his brother indicates that Hebrew who lived at the time really values the importance of kinship. Otherwise, such punishment wouldn't be made. One thing that didn't make much sense though is that if Kinship is a heavy emphasis on the culture, then why would Abel kill Cain at the first place?To take a wild guess, because Cain craves God's approval, the jealousy or the neediness of God's care turn him into a brother-slaughter.
